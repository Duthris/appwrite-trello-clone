# Appwrite Cloud + Next.js Trello Clone

DEMO ðŸ‘‰[Duthris Trello Demo](https://trello.duthris.com/)

This is an example demo to try [Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/) powered frontend for the trello daily task app using [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/).

## Setup

Get the code by either cloning this repository using git

```
git clone https://github.com/Duthris/appwrite-trello-clone.git
```

Once downloaded, open the terminal in the project directory, and install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

Once you have created a web project, and inside of it, a database and collection for that database, and a storage to store images, give localhost to hostname of the project in appwrite cloud.
Then see the .env.local.example file and rename it as .env.local. Then set your appwrite cloud project id, database id, collection id, and storage id.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID='YOUR APPWRITE CLOUD PROJECT ID'
NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABASE_ID='YOUR APPWRITE DATABASE ID'
NEXT_PUBLIC_TODOS_COLLECTION_ID='YOUR APPWRITE COLLECTION ID'
NEXT_PUBLIC_TODOS_STORAGE_ID='YOUR APPWRITE STORAGE ID'
```

Then start the example app with:

```
npm run dev
```

The app should now be up and running at http://localhost:3000 ðŸš€
